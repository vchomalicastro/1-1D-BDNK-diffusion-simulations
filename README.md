# (1+1)D BDNK Diffusion Simulations
SA-PINN-ACTO (physics-informed neural network) and KT (Kurganov-Tadmor) simulations to BDNK diffusion in (1+1)D, as used in "Solving BDNK diffusion using physics-informed neural networks" (Chomali-Castro, Clarisse, Mullins, Noronha, 2026).

---

## Overview

This repository contains Python code for simulating BDNK diffusion both with the SA-PINN-ACTO technique and with a finite-volume Kurganov-Tadmor scheme. The SA-PINN-ACTO is a variant of the vanilla physics-informed neural network, and in particular, a variant of the self-adaptive PINN (SA-PINN). These codes generate all the results in section **IV. Numerical results for BDNK diffusion** of the paper, as well as of **Appendix B: First- vs. second-order formulation of the BDNK diffusion problem for the SA-PINN-ACTO** and **Appendix D: Results of convergence tests**.
